  <title>Classroom-Based Assessment 1: Mathematical Investigation</title>

  <section>
    <title>What is this assessment?</title>
    <p>
      This Classroom-Based Assessment (CBA) is a mathematical investigation.
      You will choose a question, explore it using mathematics, and explain what you discover.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is <em>not</em> a written test. It is not about memorising methods or getting one correct
      final answer. It is about how you think, model a situation, solve problems, and communicate
      your ideas clearly.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>What you will be assessed on</title>
    <p>This assessment focuses on four key skills:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Problem solving</li>
      <li>Mathematical modelling</li>
      <li>Reasoning and justification</li>
      <li>Clear mathematical communication</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>The investigation process</title>
    <p>
      Your investigation will usually follow these four stages. These stages are not strictly linear
      – you may move back and forth between them.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <em>Choose and define a question</em><br/>
        Pick a question that interests you. It may come from mathematics, another subject,
        or the real world.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Plan your approach</em><br/>
        Decide what information matters, what assumptions you are making,
        and how you will represent the situation mathematically.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Do the mathematics</em><br/>
        Use calculations, graphs, tables, diagrams, or technology to explore the problem and find results.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Interpret and explain</em><br/>
        Explain what your results mean, whether they make sense, and what the limitations
        of your investigation are.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Choice and collaboration</title>
    <p>This investigation is designed to give you choice and independence.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You choose the topic of your investigation.</li>
      <li>You choose how to present your work.</li>
      <li>You may discuss ideas with others, but what you submit must be your own work.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>What you must submit</title>
    <p>
      You will submit one final piece of work that clearly shows your investigation and your thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you choose a written report, it will usually be about 400–600 words.
      Other formats such as posters, slides, or short videos are also allowed,
      provided your mathematics and reasoning are clearly explained.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>How your work is judged</title>
    <p>Your work will be judged based on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How clearly your problem is defined</li>
      <li>How effectively you use mathematics</li>
      <li>How well you explain and justify your thinking</li>
      <li>How clearly your conclusions connect back to the original question</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Your work will be described as:
      <em>Yet to meet expectations</em>, <em>In line with expectations</em>,
      <em>Above expectations</em>, or <em>Exceptional</em>.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Why results are not given immediately</title>
    <p>
      After the investigation, mathematics teachers meet to compare samples of student work
      and agree standards. This helps ensure fairness and consistency.
    </p>
    <p>Because of this process, results are not given immediately.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Next steps</title>
    <p>
      Examples of investigations and further guidance will be provided.
      Use these for inspiration, not for copying.
