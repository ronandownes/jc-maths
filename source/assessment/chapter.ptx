  <title>Classroom-Based Assessment 1: Mathematical Investigation</title>

  <section>
    <title>What is this assessment?</title>
    <p>
      This Classroom-Based Assessment (CBA) is a mathematical investigation.
      You will choose a question, explore it using mathematics, and explain what you discover.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is <em>not</em> a written test. It is not about memorising methods or getting one correct
      final answer. It is about how you think, model a situation, solve problems, and communicate
      your ideas clearly.
    </p>

  <section>
    <title>What you will be assessed on</title>
    <p>This assessment focuses on four key skills:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Problem solving</p></li>
      <li><p>Mathematical modelling</p></li>
      <li><p>Reasoning and justification</p></li>
      <li><p>Clear mathematical communication</p></li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>The investigation process</title>
    <p>
      Your investigation will usually follow these four stages. These stages are not strictly linear.
      You may move back and forth between them.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p><em>Choose and define a question</em></p>
        <p>
          Pick a question that interests you. It may come from mathematics,
          another subject, or the real world.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><em>Plan your approach</em></p>
        <p>
          Decide what information matters, what assumptions you are making,
          and how you will represent the situation mathematically.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><em>Do the mathematics</em></p>
        <p>
          Use calculations, graphs, tables, diagrams, or technology to explore
          the problem and find results.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><em>Interpret and explain</em></p>
        <p>
          Explain what your results mean, whether they make sense,
          and what the limitations of your investigation are.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Choice and collaboration</title>
    <ul>
      <li><p>You choose the topic of your investigation.</p></li>
      <li><p>You choose how to present your work.</p></li>
      <li><p>You may discuss ideas with others, but what you submit must be your own work.</p></li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>What you must submit</title>
    <p>
      You will submit one final piece of work that clearly shows your investigation and your thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      A written report is usually 400–600 words. Other formats such as posters,
      slides, or short videos may be used if your mathematics and reasoning are clearly explained.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>How your work is judged</title>
    <p>
      Your work will be described as <em>Yet to meet expectations</em>,
      <em>In line with expectations</em>, <em>Above expectations</em>,
      or <em>Exceptional</em>.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Why results are not given immediately</title>
    <p>
      After the investigation, mathematics teachers meet to compare samples of student work
      and agree standards. This helps ensure fairness and consistency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of this process, results are not given immediately.
