  <title>Project Ideas for Mathematical Investigations</title>

  <p>
    The following project ideas are examples of investigations that students may choose
    from when completing a Classroom-Based Assessment (CBA). Each project allows students
    to demonstrate problem-solving, modelling, reasoning, and communication skills.
  </p>

  <p>
    Students are encouraged to adapt these ideas, collect their own data, and develop
    their own approaches. The quality of the investigation will be judged against the
    learning outcomes and expectations for students.
