  <title>Project Ideas for Mathematical Investigations</title>

  <p>
    This activity provides a bank of project ideas to help you choose a topic
    for your Classroom-Based Assessment (CBA).
  </p>

  <p>
    You may use one of these ideas directly or adapt it to suit your own interests.
    Two students may start with the same idea but produce very different investigations.
  </p>

  <p>
    The quality of your work will depend on how well you:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><p>define a clear investigation question</p></li>
    <li><p>collect or generate suitable data</p></li>
    <li><p>use mathematics correctly and appropriately</p></li>
    <li><p>explain and justify your reasoning</p></li>
    <li><p>reflect on limitations and improvements</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Use these ideas for inspiration, not for copying.
  </p>

  <ol xml:id="cba-project-list">
    <li><p>How can I determine the volume of my home hot-water tank without opening it?</p></li>
    <li><p>Is the diameter of a circular object better found by measuring circumference or width?</p></li>
    <li><p>How accurate is my estimate of the height of a room using shadows?</p></li>
    <li><p>What is the relationship between the floor area and perimeter of a rectangular room?</p></li>
    <li><p>Can I calculate the volume of a cupboard or press using indirect measurements?</p></li>

    <li><p>Is phone battery percentage proportional to charging time?</p></li>
    <li><p>Does mobile data usage increase linearly with screen time?</p></li>
    <li><p>How does the cost of electricity scale with usage in my home?</p></li>
    <li><p>Are supermarket discounts always what they claim to be?</p></li>
    <li><p>How does scaling a recipe affect ingredient quantities?</p></li>

    <li><p>Is the cooling of a hot drink linear over time?</p></li>
    <li><p>How does savings grow with regular weekly deposits?</p></li>
    <li><p>Does internet speed vary predictably during the day?</p></li>
    <li><p>How does temperature change during a typical school day?</p></li>

    <li><p>What is the distribution of shoe sizes in my class?</p></li>
    <li><p>How accurate are short-term weather forecasts?</p></li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Once you have chosen a topic, write your investigation question clearly and
    prepare a short plan showing what data you will collect and how you will analyse it.
