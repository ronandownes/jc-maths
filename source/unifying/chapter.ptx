  <section xml:id="u-building-blocks">
    <title>Building Blocks</title>

    <p>
      <em>U.1</em> recall and demonstrate understanding of the fundamental concepts
      and procedures that underpin each strand
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>U.2</em> apply the procedures associated with each strand accurately,
      effectively, and appropriately
    </p>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="u-representation">
    <title>Representation</title>

    <p>
      <em>U.4</em> represent a mathematical situation in a variety of different ways,
      including: numerically, algebraically, graphically, physically, in words; and
      to interpret, analyse, and compare such representations
    </p>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="u-connections">
    <title>Connections</title>

    <p>
      <em>U.5</em> make connections within and between strands
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>U.6</em> make connections between mathematics and the real world
    </p>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="u-problem-solving">
    <title>Problem Solving</title>

    <p>
      <em>U.7</em> make sense of a given problem, and if necessary mathematise a situation
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>U.8</em> apply their knowledge and skills to solve a problem, including
      decomposing it into manageable parts and/or simplifying it using appropriate
      assumptions
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>U.9</em> interpret their solution to a problem in terms of the original question
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>U.10</em> evaluate different possible solutions to a problem, including
      evaluating the reasonableness of the solutions, and exploring possible improvements
      and/or limitations of the solutions (if any)
    </p>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="u-generalisation-proof">
    <title>Generalisation and Proof</title>

    <p>
      <em>U.11</em> generate general mathematical statements or conjectures based on
      specific instances
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>U.12</em> generate and evaluate mathematical arguments and proofs
    </p>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="u-communication">
    <title>Communication</title>

    <p>
      <em>U.13</em> communicate mathematics effectively: justify their reasoning,
      interpret their results, explain their conclusions, and use the language and
      notation of mathematics to express mathematical ideas precisely
    </p>
