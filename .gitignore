# PreTeXt build outputs
# output/  ← COMMENTED OUT so GitHub Pages can see the files

*$py.class

# IDEs

```

Just add `#` in front of `output/` to comment it out.

**Then in GitHub Desktop:**
1. You'll see the `.gitignore` file changed
2. You'll also see ALL the files in `output/web/` appear as new changes
3. Commit: "Add output files for GitHub Pages"
4. Push

**Do this for BOTH:**
- `E:\jc-maths\.gitignore`
- `E:\lc-maths\.gitignore`

After pushing, wait 2-3 minutes and your sites will be live! 🚀
