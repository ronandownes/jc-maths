  <title>Number Systems</title>

  <p>
    Mathematics begins with counting, but it does not end there.
    When operations fail, mathematics responds by extending the number system.
    In this way, each new system solves problems the previous one could not.
  </p>

  <section xml:id="natural-numbers">
    <title>The Natural Numbers</title>

    <p>
      The natural numbers are the counting numbers:
      <m>\N = \{1,2,3,4,\dots\}</m>.
      They arise from the successor operation: adding one.
    </p>

    <p>
      The natural numbers are discrete.
      There are gaps between them, and not all arithmetic operations are possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      They are closed under addition and multiplication,
      but not under subtraction or division.
    </p>

  <section xml:id="integers">
    <title>The Integers</title>

    <p>
      Subtraction such as <m>3 - 5</m> is not possible in <m>\N</m>.
      To fix this, we introduce zero and negative numbers.
    </p>

    <p>
      This gives the integers:
      <m>\Z = \{\dots,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,\dots\}</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The integers are closed under addition, subtraction, and multiplication,
      but division still fails.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="rational-numbers">
    <title>The Rational Numbers</title>

    <p>
      Division such as <m>1 \div 2</m> has no solution in <m>\Z</m>.
      To make division possible, we introduce fractions.
    </p>

    <p>
      The rational numbers are:
      <m>\Q = \left\{\frac{a}{b} : a,b \in \Z,\, b \neq 0\right\}</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rational numbers include fractions, terminating decimals,
      and repeating decimals.
    </p>

    <p>
      Between any two rational numbers, there is another rational number.
      This property is called density.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="irrational-numbers">
    <title>Irrational Numbers</title>

    <p>
      Some numbers cannot be written as fractions.
      Examples include <m>\sqrt{2}</m> and <m>\pi</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      These are called irrational numbers.
      They fill gaps left by the rational numbers.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="real-numbers">
    <title>The Real Numbers</title>

    <p>
      The real numbers consist of all rational and irrational numbers.
      They form a complete number line with no gaps.
    </p>

    <p>
      We write:
      <m>\R = \Q \cup (\R \setminus \Q)</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Real numbers can be represented on a number line
      and compared using inequalities.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="complex-numbers">
    <title>Complex Numbers</title>

    <p>
      The equation <m>x^2 = -1</m> has no solution in the real numbers.
      To make it solvable, we introduce a new number <m>i</m>,
      defined by <m>i^2 = -1</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      A complex number has the form <m>a + bi</m>,
      where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are real numbers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Complex numbers are represented on the Argand diagram
      and have a magnitude called the modulus.
    </p>

  <section xml:id="hierarchy">
    <title>The Hierarchy of Number Systems</title>

    <p>
      Each number system contains the previous one:
    </p>

    <p>
      <m>\N \subset \Z \subset \Q \subset \R \subset \C</m>
    </p>

    <p>
      Each extension is logical.
      When an operation fails, mathematics expands the system
      so the operation becomes possible.

    <title>Big Idea</title>

    <p>
      Mathematics is not a list of rules.
      It is a system of ideas.
    </p>

    <p>
      Number systems show how mathematics grows naturally,
      step by step, by solving its own problems.
